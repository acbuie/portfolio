  Hello, world! This is the start of a new, wonderfully profound (probably not)
  blog.

At the time of this writing, I am a PhD student enrolled at the University of
New Mexico in the Department of Earth and Planetary Science, and I am
procrastinating on far more important things.

I do a bit of both of Earth science and planetary science (though the pedantic
of us note that Earth science is planetary science), but mostly planetary
science of Mars' surface via remote sensing. My undergraduate and Master's
background is in geology, environemental science, ecology, and GIS.

That is rather a mouthful, so in laymans terms, I really just take data, which
is usually satellite imagery, and do stuff with it. This is fun and I enjoy
looking at high resolution photos of planetary surfaces. The challenges of
remote sensing are really enjoyable for those who enjoy both interactive data
exploration and programmable data analysis, like myself.

Lately, though, I've been running into some interesting software-related
problems in the field of planetary remote sensing. I won't get into the details,
but I have begun to explore potential career options in geospatial software
engineering.

Much of the software we (scientists) use have been developed by scientists.
These scientists truly have done fantastic work, but they are not software
engineers, and there are some downsides to that. UIs are often clunky, packages
go unmaintained, or system requirements can be either laughable ancient or
cutting edge, among a plethora of other issues.

I'd like to help alleviate some of these ailments. In my time in the sciences,
I've found that I actually enjoy writing code as much as (sometimes more
than...sometimes much more) solving a scientific problem. My goal is to slide
into the (rather large) gap between scientists and software engineers and help
write software for scientists to use.

This is not exactly profound or unique; there are plenty of brilliant people at
various institutions, government agencies, or universities around the world
already doing work like this. I would like to join them!

So, this website and blog are very, very small steps towards that goal of mine.
I have a variety of software-related projects coming up for my dissertation and
I will try to do some writing about them as I chug along!
